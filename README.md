3. **Virtual enviroment**:
In order for you to have a development environment that is as conducive as possible and not clutter your machine with many dependencies that you probably won't use in another project, it is important to establish a development environment for each project. One of the most used environments for developing in Django is Virtualenv and those who are already familiar with Docker can use it too.
